# Mp3-Player

**This code is heavily outdated and does not adhere to any coding conventions nor reflects my current experience. The underlying service `youtubeinmp3.com` is out of operation, therefore the application no longer works without modification.**

Simple Java application to queue Youtube-Links, query an online converter and play the returned audio stream.

Run `git config --add include.path ../.gitconfig` to include the template config in your project config.
